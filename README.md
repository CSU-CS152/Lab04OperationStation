Then answer the questions below.

1. What is howManyEven() doing? What is the output for howManyEven(9)?
2. What does isOdd(3) return? Why?
3. Recall the factorial code from the previous lab. Rewrite the factorial code using our new -=, +=, *=, /= (etc) operators.
4. How can we rewrite n = int(¾) using //?
5. Your turn! You are someone who hates carrying around loose change. Write noChange(cents) such that it takes in some amount of cents and rounds it to whole dollars, ignoring all remaining change. If it rounds evenly already, print “Hoorah!” before returning the whole dollars. If it does not, print “Keep the change!” before returning the whole dollars.
